<td>Virtual Production with Unreal Engine with Felix Jorge | Bad Decisions Studio Podcast #39</td>
<td>In the podcast, the guest, Felix, describes how Unreal Engine is used in the Mandalorian. Unreal Engine was and still is a gaming software engineering site. It is also the tool used for not only gaming animation, but film animation as well. It is just for all things 3D animation creation. The Mandalorian animation teams come together to design all the characters and animatronics used throughout the duration of each episode. Unreal Engine also helps that animators and actors visualize spaces and equipment since the production has no physical location that needs to be chosen. Using the technology from Unreal Engine helps to speed up the production times.</td>
